## Dungeons?

Note:

- Dungeons are places we go to solve problems and get money
- Organizations... are also that

## And Dragons!

## Skills:
### Player & Character
### Meta & Technical

Note:

- In tabletop gaming we refer to the difference between player skills and character skills
- Player skills are actually meta skills, critical to all of our endeavors
- Meta skills are the foundation that let all of your other skills shine through
- Without solid meta skills you'll always underperform.

  - Always more stuff to do / explore
  - You always improve and solve new problems, and you build better teams.
  - You will top out your technical skills for a given problem set, team performance will always matter
- Change careers or positions or foci
- Come be a better engineer tonight and play D&D with me
