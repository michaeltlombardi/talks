# Meta Skills

## Contributing to Communities and Careers

---

## Skills

- Technical
- Meta

<!--

- Technical skills are specific to a domain or role - writing code, configuring a network, etc.
- Meta skills are the foundation that let all your other skills shine through
- Without solid meta skills, you'll always underperform

-->

---

## Meta Skill List

- Systems Mastery
- Communication
- Empathy
- Collaboration
- Resource Management
- Lateral Thinking

<!--

- Apply across all domains
- Lifelong improvement
- Reinforce each other and other skills

-->

---

## Open Source

- Software (OSS)
- Collaborative process
- A movement

<!--

- Software

  Code designed to be:

  - Publicly accessible
  - Modifiable
  - Free to redistribute
- Collaborative
  - Decentralized
  - Peer review & community production
- Movement

  Beyond production of OSS:

  - Finds new ways to solve problems
  - Crosses communities and industries

-->

---

## Elements of open source projects

- Community
- Contributors
- Maintainers

<!--
- Traditionally volunteer driven, without pay. More recently, companies are supporting or hosting
  open source.
- Community:
  - Made up of people interested in using, supporting, and maintaining
  - Establish a shared mindset - goals, values, rules.
- Contributors:
  - Actively participate, writing code and documentation, testing releases, reporting issues, and
    proposing new features.
  - Can be volunteer maintainers, community members, or paid staff.
- Maintainers:
  - Project leaders, responsible for overall health and direction
  - Define and enforce standards for participation, set priorities
  - Non-absolute - have to listen and usually decide transparently and with consensus
-->

---

## Systems Mastery

> Your knowledge of and ability to **exploit** a given system, including its rules, conditions, context, and supporting components.

<!--

- Playbooks, documentation, SOP (explicit)
- Workflows, organizational practices, hierarchies (implicit)
- Ability to leverage the explicit and implicit systems
- Get changes through a CAB
- Get budget for training / conferences

-->

---

## Systems Mastery: Choosing Projects

- Find a project that fits your existing systems mastery
- Find problems, opportunities, and gaps with your expertise
- Find a topic you _want_ to gain systems mastery for

<!--

- Easiest to contribute to things you know about or use regularly
- A great way to contribute to projects you're passionate about - feedback loop
- You don't have to be an expert to gain expertise

-->

---

## Communication

> Your ability to **clearly** and **concisely** convey intent and information, as well as **synthesize** the same from other sources quickly and accurately.

<!--

- Delegation of work and problem spaces is a defining trait of senior skill levels
  - Requires accurate communication of mental models
  - Accepting delegation requires skill of seeking clarity and confirming
- Implementing a new tool
- Fixing a bug
- Handing off a ticket

-->

---

## Communication: Filing Issues

- For maintainers, issues are gifts
- Clear, reproducible bug reports
- Explicit, tangible improvement requests

<!--

- The easier it is to understand an issue, the easier (usually) it is to address
- Bug reports - "X is broken" vs "I expected X to work like Y, but Z happens. Here's the steps..."
- Improvements - "This project should X" vs "As a <person>, I want <featue> so that <value>..."

-->

---

## Empathy

> Your ability to develop and understand a mental model of another person, _especially_ their **feelings**, **perspectives**, and **goals**.

<!--

- You cannot effectively build systems without understanding the people they are for
- All code is _for_ someone
- Troubleshooting requires understanding where the user is coming from
- Our work in operations and infrastructure engineering requires empathy
- Justly built systems require thinking about who they affect
  - Just Culture by Sidney Dekker

-->

---

## Empathy: Conversations in the open

- Participating in discussions on open issues
- What to do when an issue is declined
- Understanding prioritization

<!--

- Working in the open can be stressful
- Understanding context -> effective communication
- Rarely personal, usually resource/context constrained

-->

---

## Collaboration

> Your ability to work with one or more other people towards **shared** goals.

<!--

- The most technically proficient engineer working alone will always be outperformed by 3 mediocre
  engineers collaborating effectively
- Lead from anywhere, leadership != title
- Work and problems do not scale linearly
- Managing individual, team, departmental goals
- Doing your best to do right

-->

---

## Collaboration: Working through PRs

- Incorporating feedback
- Seeking clarification
- Picking up work
- Providing perspective

---

## Resource Management

> Your ability to **analyze** and effectively **allocate** your available resources to solve problems now and in the future.

<!--

- Open source projects include folks with skills, interests, and availability
- Everyone has more work than they can accomplish
- You need to figure out how best to spend your time and effort to effect maximum impact
- How much time on reporting vs implementing vs testing?
- How do you allocate? Rotate contribution types? Focus? Improve contributing guides?

-->

---

## Resource Management: Roadmaps and committments

- Negotiating features
- Focusing efforts for impact

<!--

- Not every requested feature can or should be implemented
- How to help get a feature prioritized? Issue quality, helping, volunteering, discussing
- Where are your efforts best spent? What's best for you? For the project?

-->

---

## Lateral Thinking

> Your ability to solve problems by **varied approaches** and **creativity**.

<!--

- The meta-metaskill, builds on all of the others
- What went wrong?
  - Get bug info, try to understand what person was doing when discovered
  - Communication, Empathy
- How do you investigate?
  - Run tests, check logs / reports, probe
  - Can you narrow things down from broad chunks, then zoom in?
  - Systems mastery, communication, empathy, collaboration, resource management, lateral thinking
- How do you fix?
  - Roll back? Quick forward fix now, long term fix later? Restore 90% functionality? etc
  - Systems master, communication, empathy, collaboration, resource management, lateral thinking

-->

---

## Lateral Thinking: Seeking alternatives

- What other ways can you contribute?
- How else can an issue be resolved?
- Is this a gap or an opportunity?

<!--

- Maybe you can do tutorial videos, or blog posts, or answer questions online, or write a plugin, or add test cases, or...
- Does an issue require a code update? Can you document a workaround, or clarify usage, or add an alias, or...
- Sometimes a bugfix for broken behavior indicates an opportunity for enhanced behavior or safety.

-->

---

## Meta Skills (Review)

- Systems Mastery
- Communication
- Empathy
- Collaboration
- Resource Management
- Lateral Thinking

<!--

- These six core metaskills feed into everything else.
- They're applicable throughout your career, regardless of field
- You can practice them in a low-friction, low-stakes context with open source
- Filing issues, submitting and reviewing PRs, writing docs, adding tests and repros, discussing
- Focus on the skills you want to practice the most - they all affect each other
- Be the contributor you wish would volunteer to help you

-->
